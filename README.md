## Overview
[PlayFab](https://playfab.com/) is a backend service by Microsoft for game developers, offering tools for live game management, all powered by Azure's cloud infrastructure.

By incorporating the [Openfort SDK](https://github.com/openfort-xyz/openfort-node) into Azure Functions, we create a seamless bridge to PlayFab. This connection allows Unity clients, through the PlayFab Unity SDK, to tap into these functions, making the entire range of Openfort functionalities readily available within the game environment.

## Prerequisites

+ Prepare for Azure development:
